## Overview of the Stages

1. **Stage 1 (Days 1–6): ONNX Fundamentals with a Simple MLP**
2. **Stage 2 (Days 7–12): Convolutional Model Export (ResNet) and Optimization**
3. **Stage 3 (Days 13–18): Transformer Basics (DistilBERT) and Dynamic Axes**
4. **Stage 4 (Days 19–24): TTS Pipeline Components (Tacotron2/Glow-TTS & Vocoder)**
5. **Stage 5 (Days 25–30): Deploying TTS in the Browser (ONNX Runtime Web)**

By the end, you will have all the key skills—exporting various model types (MLP, CNN, Transformer, TTS) to ONNX, verifying in Python, optimizing, and finally running inference in a JavaScript browser environment.

## Stage 1 (Days 1–6): ONNX Fundamentals with a Simple MLP

**Goal**

- Understand ONNX basics: how to export a simple model, load it in Python (ONNX Runtime), and verify correctness.

**Suggested Model**

- A small feed-forward MLP in PyTorch (2–3 Linear layers, ReLU activations).

### Day 1

- **Install & Setup**:
  - Install PyTorch, `onnx`, `onnxruntime`, and a visualization tool like [Netron](https://netron.app/).
  - Skim the [PyTorch ONNX Export Tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/super_resolution_with_onnxruntime.html) to see the basic workflow.

### Day 2

- **Implement/Load an MLP**:
  - In PyTorch, code a simple MLP model (e.g., input=10, hidden=20, output=2).
  - Optionally train briefly on random data to confirm it runs (or just define the model architecture).

### Day 3

- **Export to ONNX**:
  - Use `torch.onnx.export(...)` with a dummy input tensor of the correct shape.
  - Save the exported model as `mlp.onnx`.
  - Pay attention to `opset_version` and `input_names`, `output_names`, `dynamic_axes` if you plan to handle variable batch sizes.

### Day 4

- **Verify in ONNX Runtime**:
  - Load `mlp.onnx` in Python with `onnxruntime.InferenceSession(...)`.
  - Run inference on random inputs and compare output to your original PyTorch model.

### Day 5

- **Debug & Validate**:
  - Use `onnx.checker.check_model(...)` to ensure validity.
  - Visualize the ONNX graph in Netron to see how your layers have been exported.

### Day 6

- **Recap & Document**:
  - Summarize any issues you encountered (e.g., shape mismatches).
  - Confirm you understand each step: define → export → load → verify.

**End-of-Stage 1 Outcome**

- You can confidently export a basic feed-forward network to ONNX and verify it in Python.

---

## Stage 2 (Days 7–12): Convolutional Model Export (ResNet) and Optimization

**Goal**

- Learn to handle more complex ops (convolutions, batch norm, etc.) and explore basic ONNX optimization.

**Suggested Model**

- **ResNet18** from TorchVision (pretrained on ImageNet).
- Compare your exported model to the [ONNX Model Zoo’s ResNet](https://github.com/onnx/models/tree/main/vision/classification/resnet) for reference.

### Day 7

- **Load Pretrained ResNet**:
  - `resnet18 = torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True)` in PyTorch.
  - Test a quick inference in Python to confirm it works.

### Day 8

- **Export to ONNX**:
  - Similar steps as before: `torch.onnx.export(...)`.
  - Use dynamic axes for the batch dimension if desired.
  - Save as `resnet18.onnx`.

### Day 9

- **Compare to Official ONNX Model**:
  - Download the official `resnet18` (or `resnet50`) from the ONNX Model Zoo.
  - In Netron, compare the structure/ops.
  - Verify outputs with the same test image to check for close numerical matches.

### Day 10

- **Shape Inference & Simplification**:
  - Install/use [onnx-simplifier](https://github.com/daquexian/onnx-simplifier) to reduce graph complexity.
  - `onnxruntime` can also do some optimizations. Explore `onnx.shape_inference.infer_shapes(...)`.

### Day 11

- **Optional: Quantization**:
  - Investigate dynamic or static quantization.
  - Compare the performance difference in ONNX Runtime between the original and a quantized model.

### Day 12

- **Performance & Summary**:
  - Measure inference speed in Python for the original vs. simplified vs. quantized (if done).
  - Document your findings.

**End-of-Stage 2 Outcome**

- You can export a pretrained ResNet to ONNX, compare to a reference, simplify it, and potentially improve runtime performance.

## Stage 3 (Days 13–18): Transformer Basics (DistilBERT) and Dynamic Axes

**Goal**

- Get comfortable exporting Transformer architectures.
- Handle dynamic sequence lengths and advanced ops like Multi-Head Attention.

**Suggested Model**

- **DistilBERT** from [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased).
- Smaller and simpler than full BERT, but representative of typical Transformer ops.

### Day 13

- **Set Up Hugging Face Transformers**:
  - Install `transformers` via pip.
  - `from transformers import DistilBertModel, DistilBertTokenizer`
  - Load the pretrained `distilbert-base-uncased` model and tokenizer.

### Day 14

- **Test Inference in Python**:
  - Tokenize a sample sentence (e.g. `"Hello world!"`).
  - Pass it through DistilBERT in PyTorch.
  - Inspect output shapes (last hidden states, etc.).

### Day 15

- **Export to ONNX**:
  - Use `transformers.onnx` CLI (`python -m transformers.onnx`) or manually call `torch.onnx.export(...)`.
  - Ensure you specify dynamic axes for the token dimension so it can handle variable sentence lengths.

### Day 16

- **Verify with ONNX Runtime**:
  - Compare the DistilBERT ONNX inference outputs with the PyTorch outputs for the same inputs.
  - Check for numerical closeness (small floating-point differences are normal).

### Day 17

- **Optimize**:
  - Use [onnxruntime.transformers](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/main/onnxruntime/python/tools/transformers) to fuse attention and layer norm subgraphs.
  - Measure speedups with `onnxruntime.InferenceSession(..., providers=["CPUExecutionProvider"])` or GPU if available.

### Day 18

- **Wrap Up & Document**:
  - Summarize the export process.
  - Note any important flags for Transformers (e.g., opset version, sequence length constraints).

**End-of-Stage 3 Outcome**

- You have a working DistilBERT ONNX model with dynamic axes, tested in Python, and optionally optimized.

## Stage 4 (Days 19–24): TTS Pipeline Components (Tacotron2/Glow-TTS & Vocoder)

**Goal**

- Learn how TTS is often split into two or more models (text → mel spectrogram → waveform).
- Export and chain TTS models in ONNX.

**Suggested Models**

1. **Tacotron 2** or **Glow-TTS** for acoustic model (mel-spectrogram generation).
2. **WaveGlow** or **HiFi-GAN** for the vocoder (mel-spectrogram → waveform).

You can find pretrained checkpoints and partial ONNX export references in:

- [NVIDIA NeMo TTS examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo/tree/stable/tutorials/text_to_speech)
- [coqui-ai TTS repository](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)

### Day 19

- **Choose & Download Pretrained Models**:
  - For example, a pretrained **Tacotron 2** model and a **WaveGlow** model from NVIDIA’s GitHub.
  - Familiarize yourself with the TTS pipeline: text input → phoneme/text encoder → mel spectrogram → audio.

### Day 20

- **Acoustic Model Export**:
  - If using Tacotron 2, adapt a known ONNX export script or write your own `torch.onnx.export(...)`.
  - Pay attention to dynamic shapes (the length of text tokens, output mel frames).

### Day 21

- **Vocoder Export**:
  - Export WaveGlow or HiFi-GAN to ONNX.
  - Again, manage dynamic shapes if needed (the number of mel frames can vary).

### Day 22

- **Chain in Python**:
  - Run text → mel with your ONNX acoustic model.
  - Pass the resulting mel spectrograms into your ONNX vocoder to get waveforms.
  - Save the waveforms to a `.wav` file to confirm correctness.

### Day 23

- **Compare with Original Models**:
  - Use the same text input on the original PyTorch models.
  - Compare the mel-spectrogram and final audio for any major discrepancies.

### Day 24

- **Refine & Document**:
  - Note any performance issues, shape alignment pitfalls, or memory usage considerations.
  - If the pipeline is stable, you have your TTS modules in ONNX!

**End-of-Stage 4 Outcome**

- You have a working two-step TTS pipeline (acoustic + vocoder) fully exported to ONNX and tested in Python.

## Stage 5 (Days 25–30): Deploying TTS in the Browser (ONNX Runtime Web)

**Goal**

- Learn to run ONNX models entirely in JavaScript/TypeScript via WebAssembly/WebGL.
- Integrate TTS inference into a simple web app that can play audio.

**Key Tools**

- [ONNX Runtime Web](https://www.onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/web/index.html)
- [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) for playback.

### Day 25

- **Set Up a Simple Web Project**:
  - Initialize an npm project.
  - Install `onnxruntime-web` (or `onnxruntime-web-gpu` if you want WebGL).
  - Start with a plain HTML + JS or a small React/Vue app.

### Day 26

- **Test a Simple ONNX Model**:
  - First, try loading the `resnet18.onnx` from Stage 2 in the browser to confirm your environment is configured.
  - Use an image input (or random data) to verify it returns an inference result.

### Day 27

- **Load Acoustic & Vocoder Models**:
  - Copy over your TTS `.onnx` files from Stage 4 into the web app’s static/public folder.
  - Load them with ONNX Runtime Web (`session = await InferenceSession.create('tacotron2.onnx')`, etc.).

### Day 28

- **Implement the Text-to-Mel Step**:
  - Tokenize/encode text in JavaScript (a simple approach or a precompiled JSON mapping) to pass into the acoustic model.
  - Receive mel spectrogram as an output `Float32Array`.

### Day 29

- **Waveform Generation & Audio Playback**:
  - Pass the mel spectrogram to the vocoder session.
  - Convert the output (waveform) to a playable audio buffer.
  - Use the Web Audio API to play the generated audio in the browser.

### Day 30

- **Optimize & Finalize**:
  - Measure performance. If it’s slow, consider smaller models, quantization, or WebGPU.
  - Confirm end-to-end TTS (text → audio) runs within a reasonable time.
  - (Optional) Add a simple UI (text input box and “Speak” button).

**End-of-Stage 5 Outcome**

- You have a functional in-browser TTS demo using ONNX Runtime Web. Users type in text, your acoustic + vocoder models generate audio, and the browser plays it back.

## Final Notes & Additional References

1. **Model-Specific Guides**

   - [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/models) has many reference models and example code to compare against.
   - [Hugging Face Transformers ONNX Docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/serialization#onnx) for additional tips on exporting advanced Transformers.

2. **Common Pitfalls**

   - **Operator Support** in the browser can be limited; check if your TTS model uses any unsupported ops in WASM or WebGL.
   - **Dynamic Axes**: Ensure you carefully define them when exporting; TTS often needs variable sequence lengths.
   - **Large Graphs** can be slow in JavaScript. Investigate quantization or smaller architectures if real-time is desired.

3. **Time Management**
   - Each day’s task should be doable in roughly one hour, but if you find yourself needing more time for debugging, feel free to adapt.
   - Be sure to document each step so you can look back on your progress.

Following this daily plan (1 hour/day for about a month) will steadily build your expertise. You’ll start with simple ONNX exports, then tackle increasingly complex models, culminating in a Transformer-based TTS pipeline deployed in the browser. Good luck!
